Banh Mi Originating from France, the Banh Mi (Vietnamese baguette) is made from a long list of ingredients that might make you feel overstuffed when you first hear of it, but the harmonious combinations will change your thoughts. The baguette with the crispy crust is filled with pate, butter, various meat types, and fresh vegetables. Top Traditional Vietnamese Dishes You Need to Try ASIA / VIETNAM Bánh mì is a traditional Vietnamese baguette sandwich | © Hong Hanh Mac Thi / Alamy Stock Photo Isabelle Sudron 12 September 2022 View Mì Quảng We love Mì Quảng.

This dish is the pride of Quảng Nam Province in central Vietnam, served for many important occasions. Pho is more famous, but we think Mì Quảng deserves much more recognition. Xoi xeo: yellow colored sticky rice, topped with fried onion and green mung beans. Xoi ga: white sticky rice with steamed chicken and soya sauce. Xoi ngo: mixed sticky rice and corn. If you visit Vietnam, try \"Xoi Xeo\" from any street vendor basket to enjoy Vietnamese rice culture in an off-the-beaten-path way.'"
