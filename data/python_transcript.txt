python a high-level interpreted

programming language famous for its

zen-like code it's arguably the most

popular language in the world because

it's easy to learn yet practical for

serious projects in fact you're watching

this youtube video in a python web

application right now it was created by

guido van rossum and released in 1991

who named it after monty python's flying

circus which is why you'll sometimes

find spam and eggs instead of foo and

bar in code samples it's commonly used

to build server-side applications like

web apps with the django framework and

is the language of choice for big data

analysis and machine learning many

students choose python to start learning

to code because of its emphasis on

readability as outlined by the zen of

python beautiful is better than ugly

while explicit is better than implicit

python is very simple but avoids the

temptation to sprinkle in magic that

causes ambiguity its code is often

organized into notebooks where

individual cells can be executed then

documented in the same place we're

currently at version 3 of the language

and you can get started by creating a

file that ends in py or ipymb to create

an interactive notebook create a

variable by setting a name equal to a

value it's strongly typed which means

values won't change in unexpected ways

but dynamic so type annotations are not

required the syntax is highly efficient

allowing you to declare multiple

variables on a single line and define

tuples lists and dictionaries with a

literal syntax semicolons are not

required and if you use them and

experience pythonista will say that your

code is not pythonic instead of

semicolons python uses indentation to

terminate or determine the scope of a

line of code define a function with the

def keyword then indent the next line

usually by four spaces to define the

function body we might then add a for

loop to it and indent that by another

four spaces this eliminates the need for

curly braces and semicolons found in

many other languages python is a

multi-paradigm language we can apply

functional programming patterns with

things like anonymous functions using

lambda it also uses objects as an

abstraction for data allowing you to

implement object-oriented patterns with

things like classes and inheritance it

also has a huge ecosystem of third-party

libraries such as deep learning

frameworks like tensorflow and wrappers

for many high performance low level

packages like open computer vision which

are most often installed with the pip

package manager this has been the python

programming language in 100 seconds hit
