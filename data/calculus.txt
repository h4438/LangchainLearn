[Music]

welcome to another mythology video let's

get going today with a very familiar

mathematical guessing game

[Music]

you all know what i'm about to say right

yep you guessed it what's next

pretty crazy isn't it

definitely not the kind of sequence you

want in the middle of an iq test

of course just looking at the first five

terms 1 2 4 8 16

most people would bet their life that

what we're dealing with here are just

the good old powers of two but then very

surprisingly things break down badly and

the numbers start looking quite random

despite all this i promise you cross my

heart and hope to die i promise you that

what's up there is a sequence that

arises naturally in mathematics

very curious

but if the sequence arises naturally how

can we discover the key to the pattern

well next time you're confronted with a

mystery sequence you could try doing

this

two minus one equals one

four minus two is two

eight minus four is four sixty minus

eight is eight thirty-one minus sixteen

is fifteen and so on

but why stop there two minus one is one

four minus two is two and so on that's

it of course not two minus one is one

and so on

and one more time

very interesting we end up with a row of

ones and so there appears to be a hidden

pattern after all now assuming that

these ones continue we can actually

calculate what the next number of our

mystery sequence is how

well 15 minus 8 is 7 is the same as

saying that 8 plus 7 is 15. green plus

orange is purple and of course that is

true for any triangle in our grid there

eleven plus five is sixteen five plus

one is six

but that means that if the ones in the

bottom row continue

and the purple must be

six plus one is equal to seven

twenty-two plus seven is twenty-nine

sixty-four plus twenty-nine is

ninety-three

and there's the next number of our

original sequence

163 plus ninety-three that is

256.

interesting another power of 2. is that

a coincidence well let's see chucking

another 1 in the bottom row and

calculating upwards we find that the

next number in our mystery sequence is

definitely not a power of two

so it's still not clear yet what's going

on with our mystery sequence

but assuming the bottom row of once is

the key

and goes on forever

we can still continue and reconstruct

all infinitely many terms of the mystery

sequence very cool

and a challenge for the hardcore ones

among you can you find another power of

two in this sequence and is there a

pattern where the powers of two occur

record your findings in the comments

okay we've discovered a cool trick for

trying to decipher what's next iq

puzzles but of course we're not done yet

what we would really like is a simple

rule a formula for our mystery sequence

that would be great right

and is it actually possible to somehow

figure out all the formulas for all the

sequences that end in constant rows

that would be even more amazing right

now a super cool way to organize our

ideas into a systematic attack on these

questions begins with the realization

that what we're actually doing here is

calculus

wait what calculus

all that dydx stuff yep pretty much

the calculus of sequences which is what

we're about to explore is a parallel

universe to the familiar calculus taught

in school in this strange new calculus

sequences play the role of functions

differences play the role of derivatives

sums play the role of integrals

difference equations mirror differential

equations and so on

and this may surprise many of you real

world calculus problems are often solved

using this strange sequence calculus

and

all of your familiar school calculus

follows quite easily from the calculus

of sequences super cool stuff

okay

today's mission

to give you a crash course in the

calculus of sequences and its many nice

applications

to begin i'll demystify our what's next

puzzle solver and then we'll look at the

amazing gregory newton interpolation

formula sounds grand and it really is

plus there will be

amazing alternate reality views of many

of our all-time favorites such as

pascal's triangle fibonacci sequence

maclaurin series and so on as usual lots

and lots of amazing mats to look forward

to

if you don't know any calculus i'd say

just buckle your mathematical seat belts

follow along and don't worry about the

calculus references too much i'll keep

it as self-contained for you as possible

all good

ready great and let's go

[Music]

okay screw calculus is about functions

so where are the functions in this setup

well let's call the original sequence f

for function then we can think of the

terms of the sequence as the values of

the function at 1 2 3 4 5 etc makes

sense right first term second term third

term and so on well actually instead of

starting with one two three and so on in

this part of the mathematical world we

start at zero with a zeros term

mathematicians

don't you just love them

anyway with that hiccup sorted we can

graph our sequence just as usual

there f 0 that was 1

f 1 f 2 and so on

ok what about the second row well the

first term of the second sequence is the

difference f one minus f of zero and so

on

and in the diagram this difference

corresponds to this vertical distance

but there's a second way in which this

difference makes an appearance in this

diagram

and the second way is what's important

for our story the difference is also the

slope of this line segment

right the slope of this blue segment is

orange rise over a run of 1 and so is

equal to the orange difference up there

fantastic the difference in the second

row are just the slopes of these

segments

so definitely very calculating right

remember in school calculus the

derivative of a function

at a point

gives you the slope of the function at

this point

so in our sequence world the second row

sequence is really the derivative of the

first row

but not surprisingly the official name

for this sequence derivative is

difference so the second row is the

difference of the first row and is

abbreviated by a greek capital delta a

greek d making all my greek viewers

super happy

if we're dealing with several roles we

put a little superscript to distinguish

between them there the first difference

the second difference and the third

difference of the original sequence

later we also go upwards as well

creating undifferences or

anti-differences

of course that is the counterpart to

enter differentiation standard integral

calculus

definitely something to look forward to

now let's just quickly single out the

first entries in each row those entries

there

say you know nothing about a different

scheme except for those entries then you

can reconstruct part of the different

scheme as we did before let me quickly

animate the reconstruction process for

you

the green plus orange is purple as

before and then it keeps going

and as you've already seen if you also

know all the entries of the last row

then you can reconstruct the whole

different scheme like this right

so for example for our original mystery

sequence these numbers in front and the

fact that one at the bottom repeats to

the right is enough to reconstruct the

whole difference scheme which of course

includes the mystery sequence itself at

the top

remember that one for later or good so

far pretty easy right

okay to get a feel for how all this

works let's calculate the formulas for

the difference of some simple but super

important sequences

[Music]

remember our mystery sequence starts

with five powers of two

let's have a look at the part of the

different scheme that comes from

differencing those powers of two

what about the second row do you notice

something

they had a powers of two again so it

looks like the difference of the powers

of two is again the powers of two let's

check that this is really true okay so

the formula for the difference of our

sequence is this

just a difference of two consecutive

terms of the sequence right now we're

talking about the powers of two so in

this case f of n is simply equal to two

to the power of n

then the difference created from two to

the power of n is this

[Music]

so 2 to 12 n is its own difference very

nice does this ring a bell yep this is

very reminiscent of the exponential

function e to the power of x being its

own derivative in standard calculus

and indeed 2 to the power of n will end

up playing the role of the exponential

function in our strange new calculus

ok what other sequences could we try

well in standard calculus we get going

with x squared so let's try squares in

this case we put f of n is equal to n

squared

and the sequence of squares is this 0 1

4 9 16. now the difference of the

squares is this aha

it's just the odd numbers very cool the

difference of the squares are the odd

numbers

let's also do the algebra on autopilot

of course

two n plus one right two times whatever

is even plus one is odd numbers cool

and two n plus one that's almost the

same as with standard calculus right

there the derivative of x squared is 2x

let's keep on going what's the second

difference of the squares

well pretty obvious

three minus one is two

five minus three is two

and so on all twos okay so the second

difference of the squares is just two

and of course exactly the same is true

in school calculus the second derivative

of x squared is two

so all in all very similar but not quite

the same which is a bit annoying

but that turns out to be a surprisingly

easy fix which we'll get to soon

anyway notice that this constant row at

the bottom of the different scheme for n

squared is of course also what was

special in the case of our mystery

sequence in the case of our mystery

sequence the fourth difference is equal

to one

if you're familiar with calculus you can

probably make his guess now what sort of

functions spawned our mystery sequence

got it yes

no

well let's keep on going okay so the

second difference of the squares is

constant

what should we try next yep just like in

school how about cubes let's see

whoa nice fizzles out too this time the

third difference is all sixes one more

powers of four

cool well and we didn't expect anything

else at this point the force difference

is also constant of course bells will

also be ringing for everybody who

recently watched my video on mercenaries

miracle if you haven't watch it after

this video also those constant in the

bottom rows are very familiar aren't

they so for example 24 is the fourth

difference of n to the power of four

and similarly we get this okay one two

six twenty four well i'd say pretty much

everybody here would again be prepared

to bet their life that these are just

factorials

and no i'm not trying to trick you into

gambling away your life that's actually

correct and easy to prove we really do

get the factorials forever and ever

after and we'll see these factorials

showing up all over the place shortly

very nice stuff isn't it

here are some more easy but also very

important insights start with a sequence

say n cubed together with its different

scheme

what if we had started here is double

the sequence with two times n cubed

well for example the difference of these

two terms

two times eight minus two times one

that's just two times eight minus one

which is just two times the original

difference 7

and of course the same is true for all

other differences

so it's clear that when you multiply the

terms of a starting sequence by some

constant

then the new difference scheme will just

be that constant

times the original difference scheme

easy right

here's another interesting important

rule which is also very easy to prove

what if you add two sequences together

term by term to create a new sequence

well then the difference scheme of this

new sequence is just the sum of the two

starting difference schemes so just

superimpose and add up like this

nice nice nice nice nice

then just like in school calculus we can

use these two simple rules to build a

different scheme for any polynomial

sequence for example to find a different

scheme for this polynomial sequence here

we simply multiply the different schemes

of the powers n cubed n squared n to the

power of 1 and n to the power of 0 which

is just 1 by those coefficients 8 2 3

and 4 and add up

okay

now to get the difference scheme for our

polynomial sequence we just have to

superimpose and add up

this means that the polynomial

difference scheme we're after has the

same number of rows as that of our

highest power the last row is exactly

the same constant sequence as that of

our largest power just multiplied by 8.

very interesting isn't it and this means

that

the difference schemes of absolutely all

polynomial sequences end in constant

rows how cool is that

in fact it turns out that it is exactly

the polynomial sequences that eventually

result in constant rules

this tells us for example that our

original mystery sequence must be

polynomial also its difference scheme

has one more row than the scheme for our

degree three polynomial up there so it's

reasonable to suspect that the

polynomial of our mystery sequence is of

degree four

but how do we find this mystery

polynomial in our mystery sequence well

once you know or suspect that the rule

is polynomial

there are a couple of different ways one

natural but tedious one which you may

know from school is to solve a system of

linear equations

then there's also something magical

called the lagrange interpolation

formula which builds the polynomial in

one easy step

i also have to talk about that one at

some point

today

i want to show you a third way to

mathematical nirvana this third way has

the grand name of gregory newton

interpolation formula or just gregory

nugent formula or just newton formula

somehow the big shots always get the

credit right so we'll stick up for the

little guy and refer to it as the

gregory newton formula

get ready for an avalanche of aha

moments and beautiful mathematics

[Music]

okay

sleeves rolled up and down to work

over there is the start of another

different scheme that ends in a constant

row now let me show you the gregory

newton formula in action the super

simple procedure for finding a

polynomial rule that fits the sequence

at the top

ready to be amazed here we go

[Music]

and that's all there is to it does it

work

newton gregory aren't people to argue

with but let's check anyway plug in zero

and the formula spits out one

plug in one and we get eight plug in two

it spits out 17

and similarly for n is equal to three

and n is equal to four brilliant

okay all this was quite fast so let's

spool back a couple of steps

the spool spool

it's an amazingly simple formula you

just have to multiply the highlighted

numbers at the start of each row by

those bracket things the binomial

coefficients

most of you will probably remember from

school that those binomial coefficients

can be written like this

at this point you then just have to

expand and simplify to arrive at the

compact formula

okay

back again to the original formula

before we do anything else let's

complete our original mission and use

the gregory newton formula to write down

the polynomial rule for our mystery

sequence

for mystery sequence all the highlighted

coefficients are ones and so the formula

we're after is this

okay

super pretty mission accomplished but of

course this is mythology we prove things

here i have to prove to you that the

gregorian newton formula really works

and i'll do that in the last part of the

video

but before that

i want to mine the gregory newton

formula for some mathematical beauty and

great applications

i'll now show you five insights into our

new sequence calculus provided by the

gregory newton formula

[Music]

first you can use the grand newton

formula to solve

any what's next riddle for example let's

say we have a sequence that begins with

the mathematical super constants pied

and find an e

so a really really mean iq test question

would be

what comes next

easy we can make up the difference

scheme and plug it into the gregory

newton formula the resulting polynomial

will spit out pied and phi and e and

then whatever spits out next that's our

answer

[Music]

there plug in zero you get pi plugin one

you get five plugin two you get e so

what comes next

well plug in three

and there's your answer

first python 5 and e and then next is 3

minus 3 5 plus pi

really

are you willing to bet your life on this

answer is that really what comes next

well

yes

and no

gregory newton has given us a simple

formula and that formula spat out 3

minus 3 5 plus pi

but you could similarly argue for any

number to come next

right so what's your favorite number

today minus 666 for mischievous reasons

and so what if we want 666 to come next

not a problem we simply go through the

gregory newton procedure starting with

these four terms

pi phi e and 666.

okay okay not pretty but it works this

example shows you that the whole what's

next game is fundamentally really silly

if anything can be an answer then of

course nothing is an answer so on your

next iq test you have my permission to

answer whatever you like comes next let

me know what happens

on the other hand in the proper

scientific context what's next is a

really important question right perform

a couple of experiments to explore

naturally occurring phenomenon and then

try to guess a natural and general rule

based on the outcomes but of course you

don't stop there you then also have to

somehow justify that your guess is

correct

and so far

that justification is also missing from

the discussion of our original mystery

sequence as i said the sequence arises

naturally in mathematics so to make sure

that our formula is correct we still

have to prove that the formula correctly

captures the mathematical context

so i guess it's time to give you that

context here it is

take a circle and put some dots on the

perimeter there one two three four five

six dots draw all the lines connecting

all pairs of dots

then these lines will cut the circle

into regions with the number of regions

depending upon the location of the dots

then with n dots the maximum possible

number of regions is the nth term of our

mystery sequence there

1 2 4 8 16 and

31 regions surprisingly

have we found the formula for that

region counting

yes

as it happens we have but what we

haven't done is prove that our formula

works forever and ever after the pretty

proof is a bit too much of a tangent for

this video and so i'll just link to it

in the description

make sure to check it out

it will be on the exam okay

[Music]

now take any sequence of numbers

whatsoever

gregor and newton will always produce a

formula for this sequence

just usually the formula will have

infinitely many terms let me explain

using a super important and super pretty

example

remember 2 to the power of n the

sequence of the powers of 2 is its own

difference this means

its difference scheme has infinitely

many rows and all these rows will be

identical there that's a different

scheme for 2 to the power of n all rows

are identical 1 2 4 8 16 etc and there

are infinitely many of these rows and

all of these infinitely many rows start

with a 1

and that means that the gray newton

formula for 2 to the power of n is just

the sum corresponding to these

infinitely many highlighted ones so the

sum of the infinitely many binomial

coefficients

so plugging in

0 1 2 3 4 and so on this infinite sum is

supposed to spit out the powers of two

really

doesn't seem likely does it okay let's

check let's cross our fingers and expand

those infinitely many binomial

coefficients

let's see what happens when we plug in n

is equal to 2.

look at that

2-2 that's 0 and of course you get those

2-2s in all the higher order terms

which means that all these terms are

zero

so this infinite sum is really just the

finite sum in disguise

works and the same is true in general

let's have another look at our example

just like for this specific example the

gregor newton series of any infinite

sequence has infinitely many terms

however when you evaluate this infinite

formula at a positive integer

all but finitely many terms of the

formula will be equal to zero

pretty magical and so using such a scary

looking infinite formula is actually not

a big deal fantastic

but there is more pretty stuff here much

more for example pondering this formula

for 2 to the power of n for a moment

some of you will be reminded of another

really iconic maths formula remember we

said that 2 to the power of x is the

counterpart of e to the power of x in

school calculus well the mega famous

maclaurin series for e to the power of x

goes like this

have a look at it pretty much exactly

the same except for those n times n

minus 1 times n minus 2 etc products on

top right but now since 2 to power of n

is the counterpart of e to the power of

x

this suggests that our sequence calculus

those n times n minus 1 times n minus 2

products are somehow the counterparts of

the nth powers in school calculus

intriguing let's have a closer look

these special products are called

falling powers for example n times n

minus

1 is called n to the falling 2 and is

abbreviated like this so it's indicated

just like n squared but with the 2

underlined and similarly with the other

falling powers

that n here is also n to the falling 1

and the 1 in front is also end to the

falling zero

very nice

also the name

falling powers cooler

and even nicer those falling powers

really behave

just like the normal powers as far as

differencing is concerned

remember the derivative of x to the

power of m

equals now mantra

m times x to the power of m minus 1.

the same is true for the falling powers

the difference of x to the falling m is

m times x to the falling m minus one

cool

a little challenge for the keen among

you prove this differencing formula for

the falling powers

leave your proofs in the comments not

terribly difficult if you have proofs

for breakfast

also in general the fix for the annoying

factor differences of normal powers

don't behave quite as nicely as their

derivatives

is to express things as much as possible

in terms of these falling powers in

sequence calculus anyway there's more as

i said our falling powers formula for 2

to the power of n works for n is equal

to 0 1 2 3 any non-negative integer

but much more is true it turns out

that we can plug in any positive number

any positive real number whatsoever and

the formula still works

that's amazing isn't it for example plug

in x equal to one half there unlike when

we plug in 0 1 2 3 etc none of the terms

in this infinite series is 0. this is a

real infinite sum but still if you add

up all those infinitely many terms you

really get to the power of one half and

of course to the power of one half is

root two

and so among other things taking finite

chunks of this formula gives us the way

to approximate root two

but a word of caution of course there

are tons of real valued functions that

will agree with 2 to the power of xl 0 1

2 3 and so on we just join the dots any

which way

and obviously for any such jointed dots

function gregory newton will produce the

exact same formula as for 2 to the power

of n

but

only for 2 to the power of x will this

formula work for all positive real

numbers

very interesting isn't it

what makes 2 to the power of x super

special in this respect what happens for

negative x for example

see what you get for x equal to minus 1

and x is equal to -2 for a really

pleasant surprise

especially if you watched one of the one

plus two plus three videos

now in general it's very tricky to

determine what one of these gregory

newton series does when x is not one of

the non-negative integers some real

mathematical monster mystery lurking in

this area that are well beyond the scope

of this video

[Music]

okay i also promised you that we'll be

exploring what it means to

anti-differentiate or integrate in the

sequence calculus

to motivate this let's have a look at

the different scheme for the squares

again well since differencing the

counterpart of differentiating produces

rows going down

the counterpart of anti-differentiating

should produce rows going up

okay so how can we extend our difference

scheme going up what numbers should go

in those spaces here

well

let's just make an arbitrary choice for

the first space on the left

let's make this

zero

then the rest is forcing us by our usual

reconstruction procedure

zero plus zero zero plus zero plus one

zero plus zero plus one plus four zero

plus zero plus one plus four plus nine

and so on

uh-huh

so while the opposite of the derivative

is the anti-derivative the opposite of

the difference is the anti-difference in

other words the sum where summing the

elements of our sequence makes sense

and this means that we can also use the

gregory newton formula to find formulas

for the sums of sequences

that's also one of the main uses for

this type of calculus finding nice

formulas for crazy sums of sequences

here's an easy example let's calculate

the formula for the sum of the squares

in front of us

highlight the leading entries yeah

and then gregory newton tells us to just

multiply these highlighted numbers by

the binomial coefficients and add

so plug in zero you get zero plug in one

you get zero plus zero that's zero again

plug in two you get one well

those two ones at the beginning of our

sum sequence aren't doing much are they

so instead of using the highlighted zero

zero one two to build the formula

it's better to shift one along and begin

with these guys to build a formula

zero one three and two

now go again plug in zero you get

zero 0 0 plug in 1 you get 1 and so on

much better

then expanding and simplifying the sum

gives you the familiar sum of squares

formula

many of you will have seen that one

before i think

beautiful and easy as i said in

generally gregory newton is an

incredibly useful tool for finding

formulas for crazy complicated sums if

you like to get an idea of what's

possible i give some links in the

description

so you can wander down this particular

rabbit hole and one more easy remark

remember we started something by making

our choice we chose the first entry to

be 0.

how would this change if we had chosen

another number let's say c

easy just replace the leading zero and

everything that follows by c

and that amounts to well just adding c

to all entries of the first row and this

says that our sequence sum

just like the anti-derivative in school

calculus is uniquely determined up to a

plus c

how many points have we lost in school

by forgetting to write plus c when

answering an integration problem well i

lost quite a few anyway very neat

everything's falling into place

that's the end of it actually no there's

one more important insight i have to

share with you at this point

remember this picture from earlier on

remember that those differences also

have a geometric meaning that mirrors

the geometric meaning of the derivative

in school calculus those differences are

the slopes of the blue segments

what's the geometric meaning of our

sums there

those sums at the top i'm sure that if

you know some calculus you can guess the

answer you've got it

well f of 0 f of 1 f of 2 those are just

those vertical distances

but they are also those rectangle areas

right those rectangles all have a base

length equal to one and so their areas

are equal to their heights but that

means that our sums are just those

staircase areas under the blue curve

but now remember that in school the main

use of antiderivatives is to find the

area under functions aha those sums are

counterparts of definite integrals in

school calculus

yet another puzzle piece falling into

place

very satisfying don't you think

are you starting to feel a little bit

like alice in wonderland

[Music]

those of you who've done some calculus

in school will remember that

differentiating is easy and integrating

is hard

what is harder than integrating calculus

well

solving differential equations let me

also quickly show you what that looks

like in sequence calculus

to do that let's have a look at the

different scheme of everybody's favorite

sequence the fibonacci sequence

well everybody's favorite except for

marty my friend marty he hates the thing

you'll have to ask him okay here's the

start of the fibonacci sequence

remember the fibonacci sequence starts

with zero and one and then every term is

the sum of the two preceding terms zero

plus one is one

one plus one is two one plus two is 3

and so on

okay

here are the first and second

differences of the fibonacci sequence

have a close look

can you see something remarkable

happening

yup the whole sequence replicates just

shift it over by one there

0 1 1 2 3 again and again very nice

very similar to what happens with 2 to

the power of n right

have a look at the three entries along

this diagonal line here

these are just three consecutive terms

of the fibonacci sequence well with the

shifting in place that makes sense and

so two plus three is equal to five

three plus five is equal to eight and in

general the second difference plus the

first difference is the sequence itself

or reshuffled a bit we get this equation

here

very nice what we've isolated here is a

difference equation the fibonacci

sequence is the solution to this

difference equation

together with the initial values 0 and

1.

the niftiest part is that you can also

solve this difference equation pretty

much exactly as the corresponding now

warning warning

big words coming up but don't worry

about them you can solve this difference

equation pretty much exactly like a

linear second order homogeneous

differential equation

and when you do this you actually end up

with benay's mega famous formula for the

fibonacci numbers

pretty spectacular formula

all my disciples who did calculus with

me here at monash uni should be able to

do this can you

for those of you interested in the

details i linked to a write-up in the

description of this video

just to give you a taste for what's

happening remember that the fibonacci

sequence gets repeated in its own

difference

which is very similar to what's

happening with 2 to above n being its

own difference this suggests the general

formula for the fibonacci sequence may

also be a combination of exponential

functions which ones well there's a

standard way to play that guessing game

exactly mirroring what is done in

differential equations

it all works out easy coming down to the

roots of the appropriate quadratic

equation

following this lead gets us binai's

formula

right binay's formula is basically the

difference of two exponential functions

again very pretty stuff and another

important example of how our sequence

calculus can be used to find simple

formulas for sequences

[Music]

so pretty much everything in school

calculus has a counterpart in our

sequence calculus

here just a couple more highlights there

on top is the product formula for

differentiation and below is the product

rule for sequence calculus prettier and

there the crown jewel the fundamental

theorem of calculus and below it the

fundamental theorem of sequence calculus

challenge for you prove this fundamental

theorem of sequence calculus

give it a try real fun especially if you

like telescoping sums not that hard

actually and this one well i already

discussed that one on top of the

maclaurin formula and below it the

gregory newton formula in all its

formulaic glory featuring the falling

powers i have to make a new t-shirt with

that formula here

before i get into the proof of the

gregory newton formula let me expand a

little bit on my claim that all the

sequence calculus is one way

you actually apply school calculus in

real life numerically

let's say that's a complicated function

arising from an experiment that you want

to torture with calculus more often than

not we will be given this function in a

digitized way so we're given an

approximation of the function in terms

of the red points

now to be able to apply our sequence

calculus we simply have to scale this

picture so that the small step size

becomes one then apply sequence calculus

and then account for the scaling in the

result for example let's say we want to

calculate an approximation of this area

scale up and a line

note down the values of the function in

front of us the values at the red dots

do the sequence integral

then as we've seen this entry here will

give this green area and of course this

green area is a rough approximation of

the area that we're interested in at

this step

and then we scale back to get the area

that we are really really interested in

okay

nice but maybe not that super impressive

but there are a couple of ways in which

we can do a lot better by computing the

differences

now we apply gregory newton and if

there's a benevolent god watching over

us

the resulting polynomial will

approximate the blue curve very well

there now because we're dealing with a

simple polynomial it's a no-brainer to

calculate the area under the pink

polynomial curve exactly using standard

calculus

and if the actual blue function we're

interested in is not too wild

and there are theorems saying exactly

what it means then the area under the

pink polynomial will be an amazingly

good approximation to the true area then

finally we just have to account for the

original scaling and we're done

also

if we are willing to do the careful work

and if we shrink the small step size let

the step size tend to zero then we can

derive the whole of school calculus from

the calculus of sequences

obviously in this last part i've glossed

over plenty of details and ignored all

the nasty things that can go wrong but

that's plenty of details for today i

think

definitely great stuff don't you think

and after seeing all this

calculus will never again be the same

for you right

okay

to finish off

let me sketch a proof of the gregorian

newton formula for you

the proof is very pretty and

surprisingly easy

quite a few more hormones ahead for the

intrepid amongst you

ready to get your hands dirty

well in usual mathologer style i'll

focus on showing why the formula works

for a sufficiently general example

once you see how the formula works for

this example you should be fine to

understand why it works in general but

always works

so there's our sample sequence

and the row of differences and so

why does the formula at the bottom

spit out the sample sequence on top

well to explain this let's first make up

the difference scheme for n choose 4.

remember that for us n choose 4 is just

an abbreviation for this expression

now plugging in n is equal to 0

obviously makes the expression zero

right

and the same is true if we plug in n is

equal to one two and three this means

that the first four terms of our n

choose four sequence are zeros

now zero minus zero is zero and so

differencing those first zeros gives a

triangle of zeros

what's the fifth term of the sequence

well that's four choose four which is

equal to one

now

one minus zero zero

one 1 0 again and again and again

now because n choose 4 is a degree 4

polynomial

we know that the fifth row of the

difference scheme

is a constant

but since the first entry of this row is

one

it's all ones in this row right

pretty pretty and that means that at

this point we can hit the algebra

autopilot button to reconstruct the rest

of the difference scheme let's just see

what happens

[Music]

do those numbers look familiar no what

about if we rotate

better can you see it now of course

that's pascal's triangle

and that's really no surprise the way we

reconstructed the different scheme by

adding up from the ones is exactly the

way pascal's triangle grows downwards

one plus one is two three plus three is

six and so on okay let's rotate back

what's really important for the way this

works is that the bottom constant rows

are ones

and the fact that all entries on the

first diagonal are zeros

this pins down the whole different

scheme

okay now

that was n choose four what about n

choose three well it turns out that we

can get n choose three simply by zapping

the first row of n choose four

fantastic of course this can be

expressed by saying that the differences

of n choose four gives the scheme for n

choose three of course this generalizes

getting there promise again

a different scheme that ends in a

constant row is completely determined by

that constant row together with the

first entries of its rows for example

that scheme there has just one row and

so is completely determined by the one

in front

and here the diagonals of the first

entries that pin down all the other

binomial coefficient sequences

now let's build the gregor newton

formula for our sample sequence so what

happens to these diagonals on the left

when we multiply them by the highlighted

numbers well the zeros stay zeros and

the ones turn into those numbers right

there

there

now we add up in terms of the diagonals

that's just superimposing and adding

that shows that the binomial sum on the

left gives rise to a different scheme

that has exactly the same leading

entries as that of our sample sequence

but since the leading entries pin down

the whole different scheme the different

schemes of both must be the same

tada

proved

how amazingly pretty was that

well in the first instance this all only

amounts to a proof that gregory neutral

works for sequences whose different

schemes fizzle out

in a constant role like our mystery

sequence what about sequences whose

different schemes don't fizzle out well

actually it's very easy to extend what

we just said to a complete proof

covering all sequences again for those

of you who have proofs for breakfast can

you add the missing details hint

remember the part where i said two minus

two is equal to zero

and now

since you are all sequence grandmasters

that's all for today

we really did cover a lot of ground and

if you've made it all the way to here

you've earned my seal of approval

hope you enjoyed the video

until next time
