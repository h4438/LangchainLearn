BERKELEY, Calif. — Scientists believe they've identified the first animal to appear on Earth: a peculiar jellyfish-like creature. Researchers say all species evolved from a single common ancestor that lived as far back as 700 million years ago. These include creatures as diverse as sponges, insects, sharks, and humans. The study's findings were recently published in the journal Global Change Biology . The fossil record dates the first animal life on Earth around 572-602 million years ago, right as the earth emerged from a massive ice age, although molecular studies suggest an earlier beginning, up to 850 million years ago.
